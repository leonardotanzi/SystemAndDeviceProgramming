All students are requested to *up-load* on the class "portal" web page
the solution of Exercise 03.
Up-load the source code, i.e., the ".cpp" file (in tar-gzipped format,
if necessary), with explanatory comments on top of the program
(if necessary).
Please, follow the course rules to deliver the laboratory solution.



Laboratory target
-----------------

- Run threads.
- Synchronize threads with several different strategies.
- Typical synchronization paradigms.



Exercise 01 (versions A, B, C and D)
-------------------------------------

A BINARY file defines the balance (i.e., the amount on money) in all
bank accounts held in a small bank branch (this kind of file is called
"ACCOUNT" file).
The file stores each bank account data on a single line, with
the following format:
- An identifier, i.e., an integer value varying from 1 to the number
  of rows in the file (e.g., 1, 2, etc.)
- The bank account number, i.e., a long integer (e.g., 164678)
- The surname account holder, i.e., a string of maximum 30 characters
  (e.g., Rossi)
- The name account holder, i.e., a string of maximum 30 characters
  (e.g., Mario)
- The bank account balance amount, i.e., an integer value (of a sum in
  euro).

The following is a correct example of such a file (in ASCII/text
format):

1 100000 Romano Antonio 1250
2 150000 Fabrizi Aldo 2245
3 200000 Verdi Giacomo 11115
4 250000 Rossi Luigi 13630

Another BINARY file specifies operations done on the bank accounts.
This file (called "OPERATION" file) has the same format of the
ACCOUNT file, i.e.:

1 100000 Romano Antonio +50
3 200000 Verdi Giacomo +115
1 100000 Romano Antonio +250
1 100000 Romano Antonio -55
3 200000 Verdi Giacomo -1015

(in ASCII/text format) where each positive amount describe a deposit
in the bank account, and each negative number a withdrawal.

Write a C program in the MS Visual Studio environment satisfying the
following specifications:
- The program receives N parameters on the command line.
  The first parameter specify the name of an ACCOUNT file.
  All other parameters indicate the name of OPERATION files.
- The program has to open the ACCOUNT file, and then run N-1 threads
  (one for each OPERATION file).
- Each thread is in charge of reading and performing on the ACCOUNT
  file the set of operations specified on the related OPERATION file.
  The target of the program is to compute the final balance for all
  bank accounts in the ACCOUNT file.
  Obviously, threads have to be properly synchronized to avoid
  contemporary operations on the same bank account (i.e., OPERATION
  file 1 specifies a deposit on bank account 10, whereas OPERATION file
  3 specifies a withdrawal).
- When all threads have done their job, i.e., they have read their
  OPERATION files till the end, the resulting ACCOUNT file has to be
  printed-out on standard output by the main process, and all files
  have to be closed.

Write 4 versions of the program:
_ Version A:
  mutual exclusion is guaranteed adopting file locking
  applied on a line-by-line basis (i.e., each thread
  locks just the record it must modify).
- Version B:
  use critical sections to lock the entire ACCOUNT   file
- Version C:
  same as version B, but using mutexes
- Version D:
  same as version B, but using semaphores



Exercise 02
-----------

Realize in the Windows environment a producer/consumer application
with the following characteristics:

1. There are P producers and C consumers
2. Producers and consumers communicate using a circular buffer.
   The circular buffer is implemented as a queue on a dynamic array of
   size N.
3. Each producer inserts in the queue integer values (randomly
   generated) at random time intervals (randomly generated and
   varying from 0 to T seconds).
4. Each consumer extracts from the queue an integer value at random
   time intervals (randomly generated and varying from 0 to T seconds)
   and prints it out on standard output with its personal thread
   identifier.

Note that:
- The integer values P, C, N, and T are passed to the program on the
  command line
- The circular queue has to be properly protected, to avoid:
  - insertions in a full queue
  - extractions from an empty queue
  - insertions by two producers at the same time
  - extractions by two consumers at the same time
- Find a reasonable way to terminate all producers and all consumers.

Suggestions
-----------

- Refer to the Producer/Consumer logical scheme with more than
  one producer and more than one consumer working concurrently.
- To stop the application in a reasonable way use the following
  strategy:
  - Each producer terminates after a predefined number of products
    has been produced
  - The main thread awaits for all producers to end, and when all
    producers have terminated it terminates all consumers
  - To terminate all consumers (after they have consumed all produced
    elements *not* before !) the main thread may insert in the queue
    "termination" (sentinel) values.



Exercise 03
------------

A one-way bridge is approached by cars in both directions, but being
one-way it must follow three rules:
- Only cars from one direction can traverse the bridge in each moment,
  either the ones moving from left-to-right or the one running from
  right-to-left.
- There can be multiple cars going in the same direction.
- If cars from the opposite direction arrive while there are cars on
  the bridge, those cars in the opposite direction must wait till the
  bridge is cleared.

Write a Windows program to synchronize all cars traversing the bridge.
More specifically, the program must run two threads.
The first thread is in charge of all cars moving from left-to-right.
The second one is in charge of all cars moving from right-to-left.

Notice that:
- All cars need timeL2R (integer value) seconds to traverse the bridge
  from left-to-right
- All cars need timeR2L (integer value) seconds to traverse it from
  right-to-left.
- Car in each direction arrive at random time interval, varying from 0
  to timeARRIVAL (integer value) seconds.
- The program has to terminate only once exactly
  - nL2R (integer value) cars have traversed the bridge from
    left-to-right
  - nR2L (integer value) cars have traversed the bridge from
    right-to-left.

The program must accepts 5 parameters on the command line, namely 5
integers: 
.

Suggestion
-----------

Referring to the classical Reader and Writer logical scheme modify it
to manipulate two sets of Readers.
